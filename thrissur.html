                                    <p class="mb-5">This wonderful city, plays host to many spectacular monuments such as churches and temples which are architectural masterpieces. Being placed on the coastline, water bodies are located at every nook and corner of Thrissur and these help in maintaining a serene atmosphere. Tourists pour into Thrissur by the hundreds, and consist of a good mix of foreigners and local tourists, who hail from the world over and the rest of India, respectively.Thrissur is said to have housed humans right from the stone age. Several monoliths that are easily 3 million years old are present in many parts of Thrissur and serve as proof of this very fact. They are now under the custody of the archaeological society of India and considered to be important pieces that have helped in tracing the roots of the various sects that are now part of Thrissur.Thrissur is known as the cultural capital of Kerala and is home to literary geniuses, world famous musicians, profound dancers and also hosts South Asia’s largest alternate film festival. One visit to the city will tell you of how stupendous a job the locals are doing in up keeping the culture and heritage of this beautiful city. The on-going Pooram festival that takes place between April and May, is regarded as being one of the biggest festivals in Kerala, where a multitude of people and elephants gather to take part in daily processions and offer prayers to two goddesses viz. Durga and Kali. Colour and sound play a big role in this festival, where people in brightly coloured clothes, colourful umbrellas and heavily decorated elephants all parade down the streets of Thrissur and are joined by the traditional Panchavadyam players, who play loud music to entertain the crowds.

                            <p>Built after a rather Dutch style architecture, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace is a sight to behold. Finding its name in almost every list of Thrissur tourist places, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace was rebuilt in the place of Vadakkekara Palace in the year 1795 by the then King Ramavarma Thampuram of Cochin. In the year 2005, the palace was converted into a museum that now showcases a number of relics and really old antiques. A favourite one amongst several art admirers, the two-storeyed complex has high roofs, thicker than usual walls, and Italian Marble on the floor, making it a place right out of a traveller’s dream.

                            <p>Not so far away from the Guruvayoor Temple lies one of the best Thrissur tourist places. An Elephant Sanctuary, the Punnathur Kotta was initially a palace belonging to a local ruler. It was then converted to a house of elephants and now has the highest number captive elephant, about 59 of them. This is where these beasts are trained to participate in several festivals. Apart from this, the Punnathur Kotta also has a training centre for Elephant Riders (Mahouts), and temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and Bhagavati.</p>

                            <p>On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala. The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India</p>
